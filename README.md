# Rails Refactoring Tool for Vim


This is a simple vim plugin which helps in refactoring ruby on rails code.

I have been using vim for quite sometime now and I was quite happy with
rails.vim plus a few other plugins for Ruby and Rails based
projects, until I tried out Redmine. Although, it hogs a lot of memory
and is quite slow, it's features are quite impressive; especially the
"refactor" features. And I like vim and wasn't ready to move to Redmine,
so I decided to write this plugin which will help in refactoring Rails
applications.


Existing Features
=================

    vnoremap <leader>riv :RenameInstanceVariable<cr>
    vnoremap <leader>rv  :RenameLocalVariable<cr>
    noremap  <leader>ic  :IndentFile<cr>
    noremap  <leader>mf  :MoveCurrentFile<cr>
    noremap  <leader>cf  :CopyCurrentFile<cr>
    noremap  <leader>rc  :RenameController<cr>
    vnoremap <leader>em  :ExtractMethod<cr>
    noremap  <leader>iv  :InlineVariable<cr>

Any of you having a doubt here, _vnoremap_ corresponds to mapping in the
visual mode and the rest are in normal mode. You can map these to any
other keys as per your needs.


Upcoming Features
=================

* Renaming Models
* Move code to callbacks

and quite a few others.
